# Babble Notebook

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that generates babbling text through markov chains.  It provides a simple UI for generating and preserving output, and can use both individual text files and directories of files as the corpus.

For poetry and song generation the notebook also features a reverse-babbler that attempts to create phrases of a specified length that end in a word that rhymes with the seed word.
